These examples show the usage of random generator in CastleRandom.

They are deprecated, as CastleRandom is going to be moved out of CGE repository soon.
In most CGE projects, including games, it's completely fine
to just use default FPC/Delphi Random implementation.
CGE makes sure to call Randomize in initialization.
