  { Custom, fast random number generator.
    Implementation of XorShift algorithm for random numbers generation.
    In some cases it works 2 to 3 times faster than native
    FPC random function. It also allows for multiple
    repeatable random seeds to support parallel pseudo-random sequences.
    The algorithm should not be used for cryptographic purposes, because
    it's speed-oriented (with quality ok for game, but not cryptographic use),
    and might subject to change in future. }

    { Initializes current seed. The seed must be a non-zero integer.
      Provide Zero value to initialize random seed based on
      current time (CPU ticks) and some other paramteres.
      This procedure is thread-safe, you'll get different random seeds
      even if initialization happens absolutely simultaneously. }

   xorshift algorithm are not too different,
   but we want them really independent for random seed initialization.
   So, multiple xorshift64 will take this "little" difference and eventually
   transform it into truly unpredictable number in 1..high(QWORD) range}

  b64 := c64;   //and use our another random seed based on current thread memory allocation
  {can this actually damage randomness in case of randomization happens only once
   as b64 will be constant then?}

    {This random seed initialization follows SysUtils random.
     Actually it is a relatively bad initialization for random numbers
     comparing to *nix /dev/urandom.
     It provides a limited amount of random numbers and it has a step of
     15 or 16 ms, so it's not continuous. Moreover it has just 5 mlns of
     possible values per 24 hours while xorshift32 supports for high(LongWord) -
     i.e. we get ~800 times less variants or 2400 times less
     as a "normal" user doesn't run computer for longer than 8 hours.
     And even less than that in case the player runs the game near the time
     the computer starts - just 200 thousands of combinations for 1 hour.

     On the other hand that's relatively enough for a computer game.

     Another, much more serious problem is that initializing 2 random generators
     semi-simultaneously will seed them with EQUAL seeds
     which we obviously don't want to.}

     to kill any possible link to GetTickCount64}
    XorShift64; XorShift64; XorShift64; XorShift64; XorShift64; XorShift64;
    {the same note on quantity of xorshift's as above}

    {now we have to make sure adding "now" won't overflow our c64 variable
     and add a few xorshift64-cycles just for fun in case it will.}
    while (c64 > High(QWord) - DateOrder) do XorShift64;

    {to kill a random discretness introduced by gettickcount64 we add "now".
     "now" and gettickcount64 are not independent and, in fact, change
     synchronously. But after several xorshift64-s c64 has no information
     left off gettickcount64 and therefore we introduce an additional
     semi-independent shift into the random seed}
    c64 += QWord(Round(CastleNow * DateMultiplier));
    {now we are sure that the player will get a different random seed even
     in case he/she launches the game exactly at the same milisecond since
     the OS startup - different date&time will shift the random seed...
     unless he/she deliberately sets the date&time&tick to some specific value}

    {and another 64-bit XorShift cycle to kill everything left off "now"}
    XorShift64;
  end else
    c64 := Store64bitSeed; //else - just grab the last seed.

  {Now we cycle xorshift64 as we have a decent random c64 variable}
